# Guess
A guessing game written in AArch64/ARM64 assembly for MacOS. 

## Game
The computer picks a number 1-10 at random. The user must guess the number in as
little tries as possible. When the guess is too low the prompt will say the 
guess was too low. When the guess is too high the prompt will say the guess is 
too high. When the guess is right the game ends.
